 <ol>I consider myself a positive person who wants to learn a lot about everything related to my degree. I would like to explore all the barriers until I find
    what favors me the most, in this way I must say that I am quite extroverted although responsible in my work and in this way I can remain firm in certain situations
    With many or few people, I like orderly work, although sometimes I am a bit "controlling" in that sense, I am always willing to give my best.

    <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-star" id="Titulo" >Work experience</i> 
<ol>During the year 2023 from 04/19 to 06/18 I was living in Lisbon (Portugal) thanks to the ERASMUS project that I achieved with effort during my studies at IES San Jeronimo
    In this way I was in a company called Clariter where I was assigned test tasks and I was further trained in HTML, CSS, Python, Low-code and even No-Code </ol>
